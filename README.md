# Digital Communications

This repository contains the course project for the **Digital Communications** university course for the
academic period of 2018-2019 done by <a href="https://github.com/PARVD0XSVPR3ME">Panagiotis
Charalampopoulos</a>.

## Part A - Huffman coding

Implemented three functions in MATLAB that do the following:

1. Generate Huffman code dictionary for source with known probability model
2. Encode sequence of symbols by Huffman encoding
3. Decode binary code by Huffman decoding

Used the above functions in order to encode the sequence of source symbols and calculated the average codeword
length and the compression efficiency.

## Part B - Differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM)

Implemented a DPCM encoder
